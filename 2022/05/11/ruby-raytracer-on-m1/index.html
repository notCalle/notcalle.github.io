  <section class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>While doing something else than I was planning to, I accedentally came back to
the raytracer I once wrote in Ruby, and decided that the important thing just
now is to benchmark my <em>MacBook Pro M1</em> against those old results. I guess
this will actually be <em>Ruby 3 on M1</em> vs <em>Ruby 2 on i7</em>, because time happened.</p>

<h3 id="single-threaded">Single-threaded</h3>

<p>Starting out with the single threaded teapot rendering benchmark. This should
give a pretty good measure of raw performance.</p>

<h6 id="macbook-pro-m1-2021">MacBook Pro M1 (2021)</h6>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[1] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 0.272459 s
Render time: 354.255657 s
 Total time: 354.528116 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h6 id="imac-i7-2012">iMac i7 (2012)</h6>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[1] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 0.532384 s
Render time: 259.392946 s
 Total time: 259.92533 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait? Setup time is twice as fast, but rendering is 30% slower? To quote
Arueshalae, <em>something is not right here.</em></p>

<h3 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded</h3>

<p>This the one that made the i7 melt, without providing much more pixels per
second than at half the threads. Let’s see how the M1 fares here. Both have
about the same capacity of maximum performance threads, and the same total
level of parallelism. <em>4C + 4c</em> vs <em>4C * 2T</em>.</p>

<h6 id="macbook-pro-m1-2021-1">MacBook Pro M1 (2021)</h6>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[2] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">8</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 0.261933 s
Render time: 70.432901 s
 Total time: 70.694834 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, render time is about 1/5 of single-threaded. With the highly suboptimal
implementation, I guess this is about as good as can be expected. I think this
was the first time I could actually hear the CPU fan, in the year I’ve had
this machine.</p>

<h6 id="imac-i7-2012-1">iMac i7 (2012)</h6>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[3] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">8</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 0.560456 s
Render time: 77.613168 s
 Total time: 78.173624 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re suddenly doing better than the i7, but that might be due to
thermal throttling? Could also be that the “efficiency” cores add more crunch
to the mix than the hyperthreads did.</p>

<p>Still, the setup — <a href="/2018/12/31/day-31-optimizing-triangles/">building the Kd-tree</a> — is twice as fast. This does not add up.</p>

<h3 id="face-palm">Face palm</h3>

<p>Those earlier benchmarks were run after all the primary optimizations had been
made, but before all the extra — performance draining — render quality
features were added.</p>

<p>Like soft shadows.</p>

<p>All. Those. Shadow. Rays. The Shadow? <strong>The Shadow!</strong> Rays!</p>

<p>Easily fixed, just adjust the spherical light source to point size, and all
those extra shadow rays goes away.</p>

<h3 id="hard-shadows">Hard shadows</h3>

<p>There we go; twice as fast single-threaded rendering.</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[1] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 0.240659 s
Render time: 122.153057 s
 Total time: 122.393716 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>BOOM</strong> lightning fast — almost thrice as fast multi-threaded</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[2] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">8</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 0.266847 s
Render time: 28.061283 s
 Total time: 28.32813 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mystery solved, but where’s the fun in stopping now?</p>

<h3 id="going-all-in--soft-shadows-and-anti-aliasing">Going All In — Soft Shadows and Anti-Aliasing</h3>

<p>The <a href="/2019/01/29/soft-shadows/">final original benchmark</a> was rendering soft shadows with velvet smooth
anti-aliasing, so let’s do that too, while we’re here.</p>

<h6 id="macbook-pro-m1-2021-2">MacBook Pro M1 (2021)</h6>

<p>This time we might have hit the thermal throttling of the M1 as well, because
the CPU fan is wheezing increasingly louder, and the hand rest is getting warm
and toasty like you’d want when coming home on a cold winter night.</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[1] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ssaa</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">3</span>

 Total time: 601.569721 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h6 id="imac-i7-2012-2">iMac i7 (2012)</h6>

<p>This time we’re only 2 1/2 times as fast on the M1, and by the sound and feel
of it, thermal throttling is very much in effect.</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[1] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ssaa</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">3</span>

Render time: 1501.46532 s
 Total time: 1502.028417 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>

<h3 id="my-other-computer-is-also-an-arm">My other computer is also an ARM</h3>

<p>So, I bought two new computers last year. The other was a Raspberry Pi 400.</p>

<p>This is a 4 core passively cooled beast, but still running overclocked from
1.8GHz to 2.2GHz without breaking a sweat. For normal “heavy” use, like
running video streams from rC3 all day, that is.</p>

<h6 id="bonus-raspberry-pi-400-oc-22ghz">Bonus: Raspberry Pi 400 OC 2.2GHz</h6>

<p>Sitting steady at 66°C core temperature with 30% of the rendering done, and an
estimate of 2400s to go. This estimate will go up though, because the first
30% is the easy part.</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[6] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ssaa</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 1.374378639 s
Render time: 5541.122792698 s
 Total time: 5542.497171337 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There we go. The final results are in. M1 beats everything by far, as expected,
but the RPi400 is just 9 times slower, on passive cooling. Not warmer to the
touch after 1 1/2 hours of hard work, than the actively cooled M1 was after
10 minutes.</p>

  <section class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I didn’t quite finish the bonus benchmarks, so for the sake of completeness,
here we go. The missing ones for the <em>RasPi 400</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hard-shadows">Hard shadows</h3>

<p>The Raspi only got a chance to show off with the heaviest of the benchmarks,
so let’s see how it does in the lower end of teapot image quality.</p>

<h6 id="raspberry-pi-400-oc-22ghz-single-threaded">Raspberry Pi 400 OC 2.2GHz (single threaded)</h6>

<p>Single threaded performance still tracks at about the same ratio of \(1/9\) <em>M1</em>.</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[1] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 1.375927773 s
Render time: 852.156157512 s
 Total time: 853.532085285 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h6 id="raspberry-pi-400-oc-22ghz-multi-threaded">Raspberry Pi 400 OC 2.2GHz (multi-threaded)</h6>

<p>This one would seem a bit unfair, because the <em>RasPi 400</em> only gets 4 threads
to do the work, instead of 8 threads for the other ones.</p>

<div class="language-pry highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">[2] pry(#&lt;GlisteningRuby::DSL::Scene&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="ss">:true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="go"> Setup time: 1.379623305 s
Render time: 292.012566677 s
 Total time: 293.392189982 s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The huge falloff in performance for those last 4 threads shows pretty clearly
here. The <em>RasPi 400</em> performance/thread scales pretty well at \(3/4\), given
the huge overhead of the threaded renderer, but the <em>M1</em> only did \(4/8\), and
the <em>i7</em> was even worse with \(3/8\).</p>

<p>Still, \(4 *\) <em>M1</em> is more than \(3 *\) <em>RasPi 400</em>, so the total
performance ratio when using every single bit of crunch there is, is less
than \(1/10\) <em>M1</em>.</p>

<p>More interesting is that the <em>RasPi 400</em> did the soft-shadows render at only
\(19 *\) the time for hard-shadows, but the <em>M1</em> took more than \(21 *\) the
time. The passive thermal design of the <em>RasPi 400</em> continues to amaze me,
especially given the long history of overheated pies.</p>

      Apparently, I messed up some more vector algebra. Ray / surface hits currently record the event in surface space, which works just fine for shading a unit sphere still positioned at origin. When we transform things around, and try to cast the secondary shadow rays, it becomes painfully obvious that surface space and world space no longer coincide.

      One limitation so far was that there could only be one surface in a scene. To get past that, we add the Group meta-surface, that contains a number of surfaces, and intersects with rays on their behalf. To make this actually useful, surfaces also need transforms to translate them out of their shared origin.

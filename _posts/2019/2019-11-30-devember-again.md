This one snuck up on me faster than anticipated, but here we go.

Last year I wrote a ray tracer in Ruby, following _The Raytracer Challenge_. While the futility of writing such a performance sensitive thing in something as sluggish as Ruby was entertaining, this time I'll aim for something actually useful.

I, _Calle Englund_, will participate to the next [Devember][]. My Devember will be a ray tracer. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

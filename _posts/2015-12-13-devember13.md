title: devember 13th â€” pathfinding

I'm a bad bad slacker person, and didn't keep my daily hour of code promise for two consecutive days. I did however read a bit on using Perlin Noise for prettier randomness, so that'll be a thing when I have my pathfinding sorted.

It turns out that GameKit's builtin GKGridGraph pathfinding is not really useful for my ideas about varying cost or blockage between grid nodes, so I will probably need to throw that out and replace by my own A* graph search. Started that transition by refactoring all search related code into its own class.

Somewhere down the line I have broken the screen to grid coordinate transform. Maybe unit tests are in order.

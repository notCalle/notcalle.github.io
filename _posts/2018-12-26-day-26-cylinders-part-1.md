title: Day 26, Cylinders part 1

Devember is rapidly coming to an end, but so is the book. Just a few more shapes to go, and we're done. Except the easy shapes are already done, so things get more complicated from here. Cylinders seem pretty easy, just a XZ-planar circle, extruded along the Y axis. Done. Except that it gets infinitely long that way, so it needs to be constrained. But then it's hollow, so it needs to support optional end caps for when you need a closed cylinder and not just a very thin walled tube. So it's not done yet, but probably new pixels tomorrow.

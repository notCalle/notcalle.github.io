The publishing pipe for this used to involve [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com), but I've just finished moving  over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) instead, because I realized that GitHub can do the rendering for me, and the basic MarkDown structure with YAML frontmatter is almost identical. One less cronjob running on the closet server.

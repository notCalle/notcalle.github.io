It's time to start planning for this year's [Devember](https://devember.org/), and try to figure out what to code towards for an hour every day.

One complication this time around is that I might end up going to [LISA'16](https://usenix.org/lisa16) during the first third, and might be too busy with everything going on there to keep up with a daily coding routine.

But first thing first: what to do? Probably something game related. A CRPG on iOS maybe, written in Swift?

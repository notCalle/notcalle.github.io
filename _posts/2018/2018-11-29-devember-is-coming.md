title: Devember is Coming
---
It's that time of the year again.

I, _Calle Englund_, will participate to the next [Devember][]. My Devember will be [The Raytracer Challenge][]. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

"The Raytracer Challenge", is a book about building a raytracer, from scratch, using a fully test driven methodology. The book describes each step in Cucumber features, and the reader conjures test code that verifies each feature, and code that satisfies the tests.

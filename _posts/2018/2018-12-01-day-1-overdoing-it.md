title: Day 1, Overdoing it

The first proper day of Devember is here. Of course I overdid it and spent all day coding, instead of just that one hour.

I had intended to finish the first chapter, with arithmetic operations on vectors, and points, all being represented by that single `Tuple` class I made yesterday. A large part of that was refactoring the test infrastructure, which is to be expected this early, I guess.

Then I got carried away, and finished the second chapter too, implementing colors, represented by the same `Tuple` class, and a drawable canvas, that can export itself in PPM format.

title: Day 0, Tuple Basics

Oops, I started a day early.

So, this book really builds from the bottom, starting out by defining a basic 4D tuple `(x,y,z,w)`, and a neat trick for representing 3D points and vectors by storing a magic value in the `w` component. To keep with that intent, and to refresh my [linear algebra][] skills, I'll pretend the `matrix` package in Ruby stdlib doesn't exist, and build everything from scratch.

Pushed to [GitHub][], and done for the day.

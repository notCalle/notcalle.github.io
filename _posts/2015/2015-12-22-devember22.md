Movement has been extended from four to eight directions. Everything feels much smoother that way. 
WASD is still bound to N-W-S-E. Maybe rotate WASD to NW-SW-SE-NE and extend with QEZX for W-N-S-E?

There are some z-order glitches happening when Actors with a wide base transition from a farther to a closer tile, that I have to look into some other day.

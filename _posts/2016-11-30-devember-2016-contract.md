I, *Calle Englund*, will participate to the next [Devember](http://devember.org/). My Devember will be an iOS CRPG. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

This will be an excuse for me to learn Swift, and some parts will no doubt be simply porting code from last yearÂ´s project, that was written in ObjC. There will be "isometric" tiled environments, some CRPG/Rogue like game play elements and such, but probably not much by way of high fidelity graphics or scripting.

Maintaining this schedule while attending [LISA'16](https://usenix.org/lisa16/) will be an additional challenge, so we'll see how that works out.

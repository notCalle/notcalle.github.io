Spent at huge part of the hour today troubleshooting why my API change to an `init` method was not being seen by the *playground*. Weird caching bugs? No; it turns out that *XCode* was building for *target* instead of *simulator*, so the *playground* didn't get a rebuilt version of the framework when I hit *build*. Still don't know why that changed since last time, but oh well.

After that frustration was cleared I proceeded to learn that *Swift* has the same semi-dynamic `Array` notion as *Objective C* has, so they need to be properly managed with respect to reserving space and inserting new objects.

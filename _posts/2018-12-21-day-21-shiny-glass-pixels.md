Got hit with a sudden fever on Tuesday eveing, so that put a halt on things, while spending 2½ days sleeping that off. Also, refractions took more work than I had anticipated. I didn't think about the fact that [Snell's law][] for calculating the angle of the refracted ray, only does what it says on the tin. In reality the refraction and reflection is a duality, tapering off from one to the other as you get close to the critical angle where everything is reflected, due to the [Fresnel effect][].

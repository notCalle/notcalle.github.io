![Smooth Utah Teapot](/img/2019/01/smooth-teapot.png){: .right }

Devember has officially ended, but there are still a few more things left to do, so I'll keep on in the same spirit until the project is finished.

The [high-poly teapot][] still looked quite chunky with its flat polygon rendering, but with a little normal interpolation we can simulate a perfectly smooth surface.

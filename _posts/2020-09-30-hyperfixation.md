A few days ago I was reminded that it's almost October, which is not only [Inktober], but also [ADHD Awareness Month], which I spent last year getting a thorough neuropsychatric evaluation. Someone also told me that there is an ADHD Awareness Ribbon, **AND IT'S MY FAVOURITE COLOR!!11** Ehm, sorry[^2] about that.

![ADHD Orange Ribbon](/img/orange-ribbon.svg){:.right.max25}

Anyway, so I went ahead to change the accent color on this piece of web, that I don't use that often, and probably noone follows. So, it used to be a bright _Pumpkin Orange_{:style="color: #FF963E"} which is completely different from the darker _ADHD Orange_{:style="color: #F15A29"}[^1].

Well, to do that I had to look that the SASS and Jekyll/Liquid that it's made of. :see_no_evil:

Four? hours later I was inexplicably **HANGRY**, but somewhat pleased with what I'd accomplished. Suddenly another four? hours passed, but at least I had eaten something? But it was well past midnight, and work day after. `git push`

Just a few quick stabs at things during breakfast, before work. `git push`

:scream_cat: I broke the site menu for narrow displays! For all the zero visitors during the whole day until I could sit down and fix it, after work. Somehow I had dinner at almost midnight-ish. Again. But it was all done, with pagination rewritten from scratch, because apparently that needed to happen. Not perfect, but good enough.

Breakfast, playing around with the pagination buttons. :scream_cat: The pagination gets all messed up in a corner case.

`git push` Four minutes until daily roll call at work. :sweat_smile:

I was going to quickly change <del>`#FF963E`</del> to <ins>`#F15A29`</ins>, but got hyperfixated[^3] for a few days, maybe I still am. I guess I'll know tomorrow.

Hi, I'm Calle, I have ADHD.

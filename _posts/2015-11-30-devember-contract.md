I, *Calle Englund*, will participate to the next [Devember](http://devember.org). My Devember will be programming a game. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code [publicly available](https://github.com/notCalle/Devember2015) on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise.

title: devember 17th â€” smooth actor movement
---

Actors will now move smoothly in the X-Y plane, and will find their own paths using the A* path finder. Also been playing a bit with ambient light cycles so there will be day and night, and longer cycles for seasonal variation of the day/night cycle.

Two days lost in air travel, and today's session was all about troubleshooting the crashing *Swift Playground* in *Xcode*, so nothing useful got done today. Some cosmetic code readability fixes was commited during re-reading everything to try and figure out what could possibly cause the crashes. 

Filed a bug report with *Apple*, so we'll see what happens with that. 

I guess my next step will be to try to use the framework I've been worksing on from the actual project, since I currently can't use the playground to test the things I'm doing.

I, *Calle Englund*, will participate to the next [Devember](http://devember.org/). My Devember will be *insert objective*. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

*here describe your Devember*
